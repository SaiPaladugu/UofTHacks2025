We’re Scribble, and our app lets you augment reality, share your perspective, and uncover invisible stories—one scribble at a time. So, what’s a scribble?

It’s a geotagged note, opinion, or doodle tied to a place or object. Walk past something interesting? Leave a scribble! Curious about others’ thoughts? Get real-time notifications for nearby scribbles—but only if you’re there in person, and close.

We have used Midnight's zk-proof technology to securely store user data, ensuring their privacy and maintaining ownership of their scribbles. Only the owner of a scribble has the ability to edit it. So go out and explore!

### Why Scribble?

The possibilities are endless:

- **At a Museum:** See insights filtered by art historians, students, or friends to explore every masterpiece from a new angle.

- **Exploring a City:** Discover hidden gems with scribbles from locals or tourists, storing a wealth of information no app on the market matches.

- **Interactive and Secure:** Experience the joy of shared discovery without compromising on privacy or ownership.

With Scribble, the world is no longer limited to your perspective—it's what everyone sees, feels, and shares. From museums to city streets, every corner holds a story waiting to be uncovered.
